        # Install opcache and mod-rewrite.
        - docker-php-ext-install opcache
        - a2enmod headers rewrite

        # Install drush-launcher, if desired.
        - wget -O /usr/local/bin/drush https://github.com/drush-ops/drush-launcher/releases/download/0.6.0/drush.phar
        - chmod +x /usr/local/bin/drush

        # Link the document root to the expected path. This example links /web
        # to the docroot.
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/docroot" "${DOCROOT}"

        # Create the Drupal private and public files directories if they aren't
        # already present.
        - mkdir -p "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/files-private" "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files"

        # A common practice in many Drupal projects is to store the config and
        # private files outside of the Drupal root. If that's the case for your
        # project, you can either specify the absolute paths to those
        # directories in your settings.local.php, or you can symlink them in
        # here. Here is an example of the latter option:
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/config" "${DOCROOT}/../config"
        - ln -snf "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/files-private" "${DOCROOT}/../files-private"

      # Commands that import files, databases,  or other assets. When an
      # existing preview is refreshed, the build workflow starts here,
      # skipping the init step, because the results of that step will
      # already be present.
      update:
        # Use the tugboat-specific Drupal settings.
        - cp "${TUGBOAT_ROOT}/.tugboat/settings.local.php" "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/"

        # Install/update packages managed by composer, including drush.
        - composer install --optimize-autoloader

        # Alternatively, another common practice is to use the
        # stage_file_proxy Drupal module. This module lets Drupal serve
        # files from another publicly-accessible Drupal site instead of
        # syncing the entire files directory into the Tugboat Preview.
        # This results in smaller previews and reduces the build time.
        - composer require --dev drupal/stage_file_proxy
        - vendor/bin/drush pm:enable --yes stage_file_proxy
        - vendor/bin/drush config:set --yes stage_file_proxy.settings origin "${NERDSITEURI}"

        # Set file permissions such that Drupal will not complain.
        - chgrp -R www-data "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files"
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type d -exec chmod 2775 {} \;
        - find "${DOCROOT}/sites/default/files" -type f -exec chmod 0664 {} \;

      # Commands that build the site. This is where you would add things
      # like feature reverts or any other drush commands required to
      # set up or configure the site. When a preview is built from a

      # and update steps, because the results of those are inherited
      # from the base preview.
